# Notice:

VIN is the most important condition, but is **<span style="color: #ff0000;">not the only rule</span>** that can import a car to China. Such as steering wheel position (Britisch car), color of brake light (American car) and other conditions. But the European car is not described in front of the problem. Some diesel cars will have also problems, because those cars can not drive in some cities (like Beijing, Shanghai). You still need to ask your customer whether they want to buy a diesel car.
